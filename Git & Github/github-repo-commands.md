# Step-by-Step Guide to Push Files to a Remote Git Repository

## Optional Steps

- If you haven't configured your Git username and email, use the following commands before committing:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

## 1. Initialize a Git Repository
```bash
git init
```
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

## 2. Add Files to the Repository
```bash
git add .
```
This command stages all the files in your directory for a commit.

## 3. Commit the Files
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
This command commits your staged files with a message describing the changes.

## 4. Add the Remote Repository
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:EhsaasChaudhary/dfdf.git
```
This links your local repository to a remote repository hosted on GitHub.

### Options for `git remote`
- `git remote -v`: Lists the remotes and their URLs.
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
- `git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>`: Renames a remote.
  ```bash
  git remote rename origin upstream
  ```
- `git remote remove <name>`: Removes a remote.
  ```bash
  git remote remove origin
  ```

## 5. Rename the Default Branch
```bash
git branch -M main
```
This command renames the default branch to `main`.

### Options for `git branch`
- `git branch -a`: Lists all branches, including remote branches.
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```
- `git branch -d <branch>`: Deletes a local branch.
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature-branch
  ```
- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch>`: Sets upstream tracking for a branch.
  ```bash
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
  ```

## 6. Push the Code to the Remote Repository
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
This command pushes the changes in your local `main` branch to the `main` branch of the remote repository and sets the remote as the default upstream.

### Options for `git push`
- `-f`: Forces the push, overwriting changes.
  ```bash
  git push -f
  ```
- `--tags`: Pushes all tags to the remote repository.
  ```bash
  git push --tags
  ```
- `--delete <remote>/<branch>`: Deletes a branch on the remote repository.
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete feature-branch
  ```
  
## 7. Git Tags

Tags are used in Git to mark specific points in a repository's history, often used to indicate release versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.1`). Tags are immutable references to commits.

### Types of Tags

1. **Lightweight Tags**: These are simple pointers to a commit, without any additional metadata.
   ```bash
   git tag <tagname>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0
   ```

2. **Annotated Tags**: These are stored as full objects in the Git database and include metadata like the tagger's name, email, and date. Annotated tags are recommended for public releases.
   ```bash
   git tag -a <tagname> -m "Tag message"
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release"
   ```

### Listing Tags
To see all tags in the repository:
```bash
git tag
```

### Deleting Tags
To delete a tag locally:
```bash
git tag -d <tagname>
```

To delete a tag remotely:
```bash
git push origin --delete <tagname>
```

### Pushing Tags to a Remote Repository
To push a single tag:
```bash
git push origin <tagname>
```

To push all tags:
```bash
git push origin --tags
```

### Checking Out a Tag
While tags cannot be directly modified, you can check out a tag to view its associated commit:
```bash
git checkout <tagname>
```

## 8. Git Show

The `git show` command is used to display detailed information about Git objects such as commits, tags, or trees. It is commonly used to inspect the details of a specific commit.

### Syntax
```bash
git show <object>
```

### Use Cases
1. **Viewing a Commit**: Displays details of a commit including the author, date, commit message, and changes made.
   ```bash
   git show <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Viewing a Tag**: Shows information about a specific tag, including its metadata and associated commit.
   ```bash
   git show <tagname>
   ```

3. **Viewing a File at a Specific Commit**: Outputs the content of a file as it existed in a given commit.
   ```bash
   git show <commit-hash>:<filepath>
   ```

### Options
- `--name-only`: Shows only the names of changed files in a commit.
  ```bash
  git show --name-only <commit-hash>
  ```

- `--name-status`: Displays the names of changed files along with their status (added, modified, deleted).
  ```bash
  git show --name-status <commit-hash>
  ```

- `--pretty`: Formats the output. For example:
  ```bash
  git show --pretty=oneline <commit-hash>
  ```

- `--stat`: Shows a summary of changes including file names, insertions, and deletions.
  ```bash
  git show --stat <commit-hash>
  ```

### Examples
- Show the latest commit:
  ```bash
  git show
  ```

- Show details of a specific commit:
  ```bash
  git show 4f2e5a7
  ```

- Show a specific file from a commit:
  ```bash
  git show 4f2e5a7:src/main.java
  ```

### Notes
The `git show` command is a powerful tool for inspecting repository history and understanding changes. It combines commit and diff information for a holistic view of the repository state.
