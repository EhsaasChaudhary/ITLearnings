# Git Init

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the specified directory. This command creates a `.git` folder that contains all the metadata and history for the repository.

### **Usage**:
```bash
git init [directory]
```

- If no directory is specified, it initializes the current folder.

### **Options**:
- `--bare`: Initializes a bare repository that does not have a working directory. Bare repositories are typically used for remote repositories.
  ```bash
  git init --bare
  ```
- `--quiet`: Suppresses the output message.
  ```bash
  git init --quiet
  ```
- `--shared[=permissions]`: Configures repository permissions to be shared among a group. Common values for permissions are `group`, `all`, or `umask`.
  ```bash
  git init --shared=group
  ```
- `--separate-git-dir=<git-dir>`: Creates a Git repository with the `.git` folder stored in a separate directory.
  ```bash
  git init --separate-git-dir=/path/to/git-dir
  ```
- `-b <branch-name>`: Creates the repository with an initial branch named `<branch-name>` instead of the default `main` branch.
  ```bash
  git init -b <branch-name>
  ```

# Git Clone

The `git clone` command creates a copy of an existing remote repository locally. It is commonly used to start working on an existing project.

### Syntax
```bash
git clone [options] <repository> [directory]
```

### Common Use Cases
1. **Clone a Repository into a New Directory**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
   Creates a local copy of the repository.

2. **Clone into a Specific Directory**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-folder
   ```
   Clones the repository into a folder named `my-folder`.

3. **Clone Only a Specific Branch**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
   Clones only the `main` branch.

### Options
- `-b` or `--branch`: Clone a specific branch instead of the default branch.
  ```bash
  git clone -b feature-branch https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- `--single-branch`: Clone only the history of the specified branch.
  ```bash
  git clone --single-branch -b main https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- `--depth`: Perform a shallow clone with a limited commit history.
  ```bash
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- `--recurse-submodules`: Clone submodules along with the repository.
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- `--mirror`: Clone a repository for use as a mirror, copying all refs and branches.
  ```bash
  git clone --mirror https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

### Examples
- Clone a repository into the current directory:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git .
  ```

- Clone a specific branch with limited commit history:
  ```bash
  git clone --depth 10 -b main https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- Clone a repository along with its submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

### Notes
- After cloning, you can navigate into the repository and begin working:
  ```bash
  cd repo
  ```
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to clone private repositories.
- Use `git remote -v` to verify the remote URLs of the cloned repository.

# Git Remote

The `git remote` command manages connections to remote repositories. You can add, view, rename, and remove remote URLs for your local repository.

### **Add a Remote Repository**

git remote add origin git@github.com:EhsaasChaudhary/dfdf.git
```
This links your local repository to a remote repository hosted on GitHub.

### Options for `git remote`
- **List Remote URLs**:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

- **Rename a Remote**:
  ```bash
  git remote rename origin upstream
  ```
  Changes the remote name from `origin` to `upstream`.

- **Remove a Remote**:
  ```bash
  git remote remove origin
  ```

- **Show Remote Details**:
