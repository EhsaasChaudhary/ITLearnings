# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## **Git**
Git is a distributed version control system designed to manage source code changes during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

### **Key Features of Git**
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Branching and Merging**: Lets you create branches to work on features or fixes separately, which can be merged back into the main branch later.
- **Distributed Nature**: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, ensuring redundancy and enabling offline work.
- **Efficiency**: Git is optimized for speed and handles large projects efficiently.

### **Common Commands**
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes for a commit.
- `git commit`: Save staged changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Upload local changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git clone`: Copy an existing repository.

## **GitHub**
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface and additional tools for collaboration, project management, and deployment.

### **Key Features of GitHub**
- **Repository Hosting**: Stores Git repositories in the cloud.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Includes features like pull requests, code reviews, and team discussions.
- **Issue Tracking**: Allows tracking bugs, tasks, and feature requests.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Supports automated testing and deployment workflows.
- **GitHub Actions**: Enables automation for software workflows directly within GitHub.

### **GitHub vs. Git**
- **Git**: A version control system installed locally on your machine.
- **GitHub**: A platform that hosts Git repositories and enhances collaboration with additional tools and features.
